# kicad_scripts
---
* This is a number of **CLI** scripts written in various languages like **_c, bash, perl, and python_.**
 These scripts are workarounds for things that are not easy to do or take a long time to do in the kicad GUI.
* Most of the script **modifies** either the **_sch or kicad_pcb_** files directly.  Thus modifing the source code to eeschema or pcbnew require closing the program and relaunching...
* As questions come up regarding how to run programs I will write a quick **HOW TO** or post the **_program.pl -help_** :)
* Also, very interested in hearing what other people would like to see
